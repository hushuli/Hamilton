# Hamilton SoundTrack Comments Analyze

The Broadway musical Hamilton is my favorite play, the data I had is the comments that people did while they are listening to soundtrack. After analyzing the comments we can see some insight.

Most of the people love the song [You'll Be Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKFN-aqPJH8) which sung by Jonathan Groff. I love it too. From the data, we can see there had 492 comments in this 4 mins song. The user comment the most is 8 comments and the average comment is around 1.5 each user.
