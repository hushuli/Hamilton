# Hamilton SoundTrack Comments Analyze

The Broadway musical Hamilton is my favorite play, the data I had is the comments that people did while they are listening to the soundtrack. After analyzing the comments we can see some insight.

Most of the people love the song [You'll Be Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKFN-aqPJH8) which sung by Jonathan Groff. I love it too. From the data, we can see there had 492 comments in this 4 mins song. The user comment the most is 8 comments and the average comment is around 1.5 each user.

From the publish day which at end of 2016 till May 2019, we count the number of comments on each day. As we can see, there have few high peaks. In the new year of 2018(around 01/2018), had most comment numbers in the three years.

I also count the number of comments in every mins in the soundtracks, The first high peak is between the 33mins and 38 mins, which is the song [Satisfied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWz2Km0UbCY). Very emotional part. It seems touched everyone.

The word cloud from the over 6000 comments in the whole soundtrack, we can see the BRAVO is most frequency word.
